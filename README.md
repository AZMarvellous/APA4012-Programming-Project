# APAI4012 Programming Project

I choose problem 1 and 2 for the project.

1.Gaussian Eliminaition Method

You may run the code with:

```
python ./gaussian_elimination.py
```

You can change the size of random matrix by changing the list `TEST_SIZE`

2.Image Compression with SVD

install libraries with:

```
pip install numpy pillow matplotlib
```

run the code with:

```
python ./image_compression_svd.py ./FigureExample_Q2/Q2example1.jpg
python ./image_compression_svd.py ./FigureExample_Q2/Q2example2.jpg
```

**It may take a minute or two to run**. Also you may change the `./FigureExample...` to the path of any picture you want to test.
