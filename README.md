# APAI4012 Programming Project

I choose problem 1 and 2 for the project.

1.Gaussian Eliminaition Method

You may run the code with:

```
python ./gaussian_elimination.py
```

You can change the size of random matrix by changing the list `TEST_SIZE`

2.Image Compression with SVD

install libraries with:

```
pip install numpy pillow matplotlib
```

run the code with:

```
python ./image_compression_svd ./testing.jpg
```

you may change the `./testing.jpg` to the path of any picture you want to test.
